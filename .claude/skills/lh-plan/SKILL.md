# lh-plan

## Purpose

Create a plan and task list from the spec, discovery report, and change boundary. The plan maps every task to acceptance criteria and provides bounded context for implementation.

## Inputs

Accept any of:

- Feature ID (e.g., `F001`)
- Feature folder path
- Optional planning constraints (e.g., "Keep tasks small", "Vertical slices")
- Optional task sizing preference

Examples:

```
/lh-plan F001
/lh-plan F001 --small-tasks
```

## Task Tooling

**On Claude Code:** As the very first action (before any Read, Bash, or other tool call), call TaskCreate for each step below all at once, so the user sees the full roadmap immediately. Before starting each step, call TaskUpdate to mark it in_progress. After completing each step, call TaskUpdate to mark it completed. Use the activeForm field as the spinner label.

**On OpenCode:** Before starting each step, emit a step header:

    ---
    **Step N/M — <Step Name>**

where N is the current step number and M is the total step count.

**Steps:**

| # | Subject | activeForm |
|---|---------|------------|
| 1 | Read spec + discovery + boundary | Reading artifacts |
| 2 | Design tasks and wave grouping | Designing tasks |
| 3 | Check session budget | Checking session budget |
| 4 | Write plan.md + tasks.md | Writing plan |
| 5 | Update state + report | Updating state |

## Workflow

1. **Locate feature.** Find the feature folder under `.lh/features/`.
2. **Read artifacts.** Read:
   - `spec.md` — Goal, acceptance criteria, constraints
   - `discovery.md` — Relevant files, tests, risks
   - `boundary.json` — Change boundary
   - Relevant memory files from `.lh/memory/`
3. **Check prerequisites.** If discovery is missing or insufficient, stop and recommend `/lh-discover <feature-id>`.
4. **Create plan.** Write `plan.md` using `.lh/templates/plan.md`. Include:
   - Implementation approach
   - Task breakdown
   - Task dependencies
   - Acceptance criteria mapping
   - Risk mitigations
   - Open questions
5. **Create tasks.** Write `tasks.md` using `.lh/templates/tasks.md`. Map every task to acceptance criteria or a technical prerequisite.
6. **Prefer vertical slices** when feature work is large enough to warrant them.
7. **Size tasks for bounded context.** Each task should be small enough that an agent can hold its full context without loading the entire codebase.
8. **Update status.** Set feature status to `planned` when the plan is actionable.

## Task Design Rules

Each task must include:

- **Task ID** — Unique within the feature (T-01, T-02, ...)
- **Status** — `pending`, `active`, `done`, `blocked`, `skipped`
- **Acceptance criteria covered** — Which AC items this task addresses
- **Slice** — If applicable, which vertical slice this belongs to
- **Goal** — What this task accomplishes
- **Expected files** — Files expected to be created or modified
- **Read-only context** — Files needed for reference but not changed
- **Test expectation** — Tests to write, update, or run
- **Verification commands** — Commands to confirm the task works
- **Risk notes** — Risk gates or concerns
- **Dependencies** — Other tasks that must complete first
- **Summary file path** — Where the task summary will be written

## Task Sizing Guidance

- **Small bug fix:** 1 to 3 tasks
- **Medium feature:** 3 to 7 tasks
- **Large feature:** Split into vertical slices, then tasks per slice
- **Risky change:** Smaller tasks with stronger verification
- **Refactor:** Tasks should preserve behavior and emphasize tests

## Planning Rules

- Do not plan edits outside the change boundary.
- If the plan needs files outside the boundary, update discovery and boundary first.
- Do not hide unknowns. Record them in Open Questions.
- Do not create tasks that cannot be verified.
- Do not over-plan speculative architecture.
- Preserve existing architecture by default.

## Output Artifacts

Create or update:

```
.lh/features/<feature-id>-<slug>/plan.md
.lh/features/<feature-id>-<slug>/tasks.md
.lh/features/<feature-id>-<slug>/cavebus.log
```

Note: `events.jsonl` is auto-managed by LeanHarness hooks. Do not write to it.

## CaveBus Summary

Append a compact plan summary to `cavebus.log` following `.lh/templates/cavebus-message.md` format. Example:

```
PLAN F001 status:planned
tasks: T-01, T-02, T-03
ac: AC-01->T-01 AC-02->T-02,T-03
risk: none
verify: pnpm test, pnpm lint
next: T-01
```

Use actual planned values. Do not hardcode project-specific content.

## Final Response Format

Every `/lh-plan` run must end with:

- **Feature ID** — The feature identifier
- **Plan path** — Path to `plan.md`
- **Tasks path** — Path to `tasks.md`
- **Task count** — Number of tasks created
- **Acceptance criteria coverage** — Summary of which AC maps to which tasks
- **Risk gates** — Any triggered risk gates
- **First recommended task** — Which task to start with
- **Recommended next command** — `/new` then `/lh-build <feature-id>`
