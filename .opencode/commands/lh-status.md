# lh-status

## Purpose

Inspect LeanHarness artifacts and summarize the current state of feature work. Read-only by default. Does not modify files unless the user explicitly asks to repair state.

## Inputs

Accept any of:

- No argument: summarize active feature and recent features
- Feature ID: summarize that specific feature
- `all`: summarize all known features by state
- Status filter: summarize features in a specific state (e.g., `blocked`, `planned`)

Examples:

```
/lh-status
/lh-status F001
/lh-status all
/lh-status blocked
```

## Workflow

1. **Read state.** Read `.lh/state.json` if present.
2. **Scan features.** Read `.lh/features/` if present.
3. **Locate feature.** If a feature ID is provided, find the matching folder.
4. **Read artifacts.** For each relevant feature, check which artifacts exist:
   - `spec.md`
   - `discovery.md`
   - `boundary.json`
   - `plan.md`
   - `tasks.md`
   - `checks.md`
   - `result.md`
   - `task-summaries/`
   - `cavebus.log`
5. **Identify current state.** For each feature, determine:
   - Current status (from `state.json` or inferred from artifacts)
   - Last completed workflow step
   - Next missing artifact
   - Blockers
   - Failed checks
   - Triggered risk gates
   - Next recommended action
6. **Do not modify files** unless the user explicitly asks to repair state.

## Status Summary Format

For each feature, show:

- **Feature ID** — e.g., `F001`
- **Slug or title** — Short description
- **Status** — `draft`, `specified`, `discovered`, `planned`, `building`, `checking`, `pass`, `needs-fix`, `blocked`
- **Last known step** — Which workflow step completed last
- **Missing artifacts** — Which expected artifacts do not exist yet
- **Blockers** — Unresolved issues preventing progress
- **Recommended next command** — What to run next

For multiple features, use a summary table:

| Feature | Title | Status | Next Step |
|---------|-------|--------|-----------|
| F001 | Password reset | planned | `/lh-build F001` |
| F002 | Billing fix | specified | `/lh-discover F002` |

## State Consistency Rules

If `.lh/state.json` and feature folders disagree:

- Treat feature artifacts as more authoritative than state.json.
- Report the mismatch clearly.
- Suggest repair (e.g., "state.json says F001 is `specified` but `plan.md` exists, suggesting it is `planned`").
- Do not silently delete or overwrite state.

## Final Response Format

Every `/lh-status` run must end with:

- **Active feature** — Currently active feature, if any
- **Feature summary** — Table or list of features and their states
- **Current blockers** — Across all inspected features
- **Missing artifacts** — What still needs to be created
- **Suggested next command** — The most useful next step
